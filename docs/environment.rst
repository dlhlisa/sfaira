Study-centric data set servers
------------------------------

Many authors of data sets provide their data sets on servers such as GEO or in manuscript supplements.
Our data zoo interface is able to represent these data sets such that they can be queried in a streamlined fashion,
together with many other data sets.

Data providers which streamline data
------------------------------------

Some organization provide streamlined data objects that can be directly consumed by data zoos such as sfaira.
One example for such an organization is the cellxgene_ data portal.
Through these repositories, one can easily build or extend a collection of data sets that can be easily interfaced with sfaira.
Data loaders for cellxgene structured data objects will be available soon!
Contact us for support of any other repositories.
