sfaira_ is a model and a data repository in a single python package. 
Its data API gives users access to streamlined data loaders that allow reproducible use of published and private data sets for model training and exploration.
Its model API gives user streamlined access to pre-trained models and to common model architectures to ease usage of neural networks in common single-cell analysis workflows.
sfaira integrates into scanpy_ workflows.
